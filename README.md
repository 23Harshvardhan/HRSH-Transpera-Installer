# HRSH-Transpera-Installer
This program written in C# is used to download and install the latest version of Transpera. The installer has 2 options while installing.

- Clean Install
>This mode deletes the previous config, mods and other settings and performs a clean installation of the Transpera client.

- Normal Install
>This mode installs the latest version of Transpera from cloud but doesn't delete the previous settings, configs or modifications added by the user. This simply overwrites the files required.
